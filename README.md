# Fluid Dynamics Solver

A parallel implementation of a 3D fluid dynamics solver in C++. Outputs simulation data in HDF5 format for visualisation.

## Components

### Domain
- **Domain**: Manages a 3D spatial region containing fluid properties (density, velocities, pressure).
- **DomainPositioner**: Determines the physical positions of each domain relative to a reference root domain for visualisation.

### IO
- **HDF5Writer**: Handles writing simulation data to HDF5 files.
- **XDMFWriter**: Creates XDMF metadata files for visualisation tools (e.g. ParaView) and links to HDF5 data files and domain positions.

### Solvers
- **RiemannSolver**: Computes fluxes at cell interfaces using an iterative Newton-Raphson method. Handles various wave patterns including shocks, rarefactions, and vacuum states.
- **DomainEulerSolver**: Controls the overall solution process, managing timesteps and parallel domain updates using OpenMP.

### Types
- **ConservedState**: Manages conversion between primitive and conserved variables in the fluid simulation.
- **Flux**: Handles the flux values generated by the Riemann solver at cell interfaces.
- **State**: Represents the primitive variables (density, velocities, pressure).
- **StateRef**: Allows for the manipulation of state variables without copying data, used for passing cell data to the Riemann solver and setting boundary conditions.

### Utils
- **Logger**: Provides thread-safe logging capabilities with configurable verbosity levels.
