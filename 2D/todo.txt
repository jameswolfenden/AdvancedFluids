implement time steps
improve the xyyx shit (xy atm)
test more
get rid of the faces arrays (you just need to store the 4 around the current cell, keeping the 'furthest' for the next iteration to speed it up) although idk if this would be faster - this is why ramon said to just be storing rho and rho' etc in mem and nothing about the faces

i havent changed the time step to be right in the 1d - done

for some reason the corner region is different left vs right corner idk why, occurs only if pressure and density are set above 0 and even if the vacuum riemann is not used
could try independently setting rho and p to above 0 rather than both at the same time
